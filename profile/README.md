# Welcome to Moonvale GitHub Organization 🌙

Moonvale is a Minecraft server project that we build in our free time for fun. Although we plan to have some public repositories, many repositories and plugins will be accessible only to those who support us on our Patreon, which is available at [https://patreon.moonvale.eu](https://patreon.moonvale.eu).

## Our Mission 🎯

We are community-oriented. Our goal is to code and provide what makes our community happy 😄

## About the Server 🏰

Our Minecraft server centers around building an RPG-oriented Minecraft Survival server, featuring many aspects of RPG games while still offering everything a player would typically enjoy when playing Minecraft survival. We want players to enjoy the beauty of being able to create stuff, but still offer fancy features and maybe even build some minigames or a tycoon game in the future.

## Projects 📂

Currently, there are only 2 public repositories:
- **[code-guidelines](https://github.com/Moonvale/code-guidelines)**: A generic guide to our specific code style in case someone wants to work with our code or wants to join our projects by contributing to them.
- **[PluginTemplate](https://github.com/Moonvale/PluginTemplate)**: Template for a Moonvale Minecraft Paper 1.21 Plugin to start off with a new project real quick. Already provides a `.gitignore`, build structure, and a nice library.

In the future, more public projects will follow.
